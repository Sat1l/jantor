![Jantor](pics/keeb.png)
Jantor is a split-ergo-keyboard which derives its features from other ergo keebs: [Jian](https://github.com/KGOH/Jian-Info) (extra pinky keys), [Nijuni](https://github.com/krikun98/nijuni) (copied controller footprint) and [Cantor](https://github.com/diepala/cantor) (diodeless design with a Blackpill)

## Features
* Diodeless
* <30 min assembly time
* Combined MX and Hotswap footprints
* Fully simmetrical PCB
* Two ways to connect the halves: jumper wires and TRRS

## Case
![EVA case](pics/case.png)
Current case design is designed to be cut out of EVA foam on a CNC laser and stacked together using EVA melting chemicals or instant glue.

Case .svg files are stored in the `case` folder, with folder `case production` having production optimised versions which have more pieces per sheet.

Raw case files are stored in `case kicad` folder in kicad project file format.
